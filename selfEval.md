# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
// I feel like I am managing my time well, but I'd say the learning curve is a taking a bit. I feel like I'm doing well prioritizing Turing and my homework, but still just getting back into the swing of things in regards to school. I think scheduling time for studying has been the most helpful for me.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
// A function can be explained as instructions on how to carry out a task and then carry it out.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
//Parameters define the variables in the function definition and arguments provide the actual data to run in the function call. 
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
//I was getting pretty tripped up with the fourth question on the functions.js activity.
